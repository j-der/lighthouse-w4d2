REST

way of organizing routes for resources
“resource” ~= Model/Class ~= Table (most of the time)

GET /thing
  lists all things;
     Thing.all

GET /thing/:id
  info about id;
    Thing.find(id)

GET /thing/:id/edit
  form for editing thing

GET /thing/new
  form for new thing

POST /thing
  create a new thing;
    Thing.create(params)

POST /thing/:id
  update a thing;
    Thing.find(id).update(params).save()

DELETE /thing/:id
   delete a thing
      Thing.find(id).destroy
